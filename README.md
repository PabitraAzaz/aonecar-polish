# Car Dirt Removal Demo

This project provides a minimal example of removing dirt from car images using
OpenCV and Flask. Users can upload a dirty car photo and receive a cleaned
version generated by a simple image-processing pipeline.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000` and upload an image.

The processed image will appear below the form and be saved to the `static`
folder.
